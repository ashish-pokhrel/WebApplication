1. In jQuery terminology, what is the difference between the “jQuery function” and the “jQuery object”? 

=>   A function is a set of statements that takes input, do some specific computation and produce output. Basically,
        a function is a set of statements that performs some specific task or does some computation and then return the
        result to the user.

        A jQuery object is a JavaScript object which is the particular collection of data you get when you call the
        jQuery function with one of the sets of arguments that populates it with DOM nodes.

2. Write jQuery code to find all h1 elements that are children of a div element and make their background 
color red.

<h1>abc</h1><br><div>
 <h1>div-1</h1>
 <h1>div-2</h1>
 </div>
 <h1>xyz</h1>
</body>

=>    $("div h1").css("color", "red");
